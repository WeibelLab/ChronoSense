# Kinectron

Kinectron is a node-based library that broadcasts Kinect2 data over a peer connection. It builds on the Node Kinect2 and PeerJS libraries.

Kinectron has two components--an electron application to broadcast Kinect2 data over a peer connection, and a client-side API to request and receive Kinect2 data over a peer connection.
