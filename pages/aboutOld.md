## Headings

# Heading h1

h1 headings are reserved for page titles and are hidden from content. Start your headings at h2.

## Heading h2
### Heading h3
#### Heading h4
##### Heading h5
###### Heading h6
###### Heading with custom id {#custom_id}

{: .alert .alert-info }
It's best to start page/post headings at h2, since the page/post title will already be an h1.

## Links

[link with url](http://www.example.com)

[link with title](http://www.example.com "title text")

[1]: http://www.example.com

[link with reference][1]

url: <http://www.example.com>

See the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#link) to create internal links. All internal links start from the `url` in `_config.yml`.

The safest (and verbose) way for internal links is:

- For pages: {% raw %}`[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/about.md %})`{% endraw %}
- For posts: {% raw %}`[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2010-07-21-name-of-post.md %})`{% endraw %} or the shorter {% raw %}`[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-07-21-name-of-post %})`{% endraw %}
- For images and documents: {% raw %}`[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/images/name-of-image.jpg %})`{% endraw %}

If you don't have a `baseurl` in `_config.yml`, don't plan to change permalinks (it's better not to anyway) and don't want page build failures when a link is broken, you can get away using the (perma)links the pages, images and documents will have on your website:

- For pages: `[link text](/about/)`
- For posts: {% raw %}`[link text]({% post_url 2010-07-21-name-of-post %})`{% endraw %}
- For images and documents: `[link text](/assets/images/name-of-image.jpg)`

## Footnotes

## Images

_You can add an image caption by including an `_emphasized sentence_` directly below the image without inserting a new line. This will wrap both image and caption in a paragraph._

See the [the links section](#links) to learn how to reference your own images and documents.

## Styling content

With the Kramdown Markdown parser that Jekyll uses, you can add css classes to your content (see this [blog post](https://digitaldrummerj.me/styling-jekyll-markdown/)). By sticking to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/) classes, you can easily style your content. If that doesn't fit your needs, you can always write html in your Markdown.

### Alerts

[Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/)

{: .alert .alert-info}
Alert info message. This paragraph is styled by prepending it with `{: .alert .alert-info}`.

### Aligning images

[Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/images/#aligning-images)

By default, images will be centered horizontally and use the full width if they can.

The image below is wrapped in a paragraph with `{: .col-md-8 .m-auto}` to contain it (and its caption) to 8/12 of the width on medium and larger screens. On small screens the full width will be used. Controlling the width of an image is especially useful for portrait images.

{: .col-md-8 .m-auto}
![alt text](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486825586573-7131f7991bdd?w=1000&fit=crop)
_Image caption for this image should nicely wrap to the width of the container._

The image below is styled with `{: .rounded .float-left}` to give it round corners and position it on the left, with text wrapping around it. You can use `{: .clearfix}` on a paragraph to stop wrapping.

![alt text](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486825586573-7131f7991bdd?w=150&h=150&fit=crop){: .rounded .float-left}
